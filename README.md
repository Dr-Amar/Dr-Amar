## 👤 About Me

Dr. Muhammad Amar Gul is a Research Scientist specializing in AI4Science and scientific machine learning, with a strong foundation in geochemistry and mineral systems. His work focuses on developing robust, uncertainty-aware, and interpretable machine learning methodologies for limited, imbalanced, and heterogeneous scientific datasets. With more than 10 years of experience spanning industry and research environments in Saudi Arabia, Australia, and China, he integrates deep learning, ensemble models, and explainable AI techniques to advance mineral exploration, metallogenic discrimination, and large-scale geospatial data analysis. As Founder and Director of AIMEX Lab (Artificial Intelligence for Mineral Exploration Laboratory), he bridges advanced AI methodologies with real-world Earth-system challenges, contributing to sustainable critical-mineral development and next-generation scientific discovery.


## 🧠 Research Identity

I pursue methodology-driven machine learning for scientific discovery (AI4Science), focusing on probabilistic, uncertainty-aware, interpretable, and robust ML for limited, imbalanced, and heterogeneous datasets.

**Core Interests**

- Robust Generalization under data scarcity  
- Imbalanced & heterogeneous dataset learning  
- Interpretable AI (SHAP, feature attribution)  
- Out-of-distribution validation  
- AI for Critical Mineral Systems  

Bridging **AI theory and mineral system science** for sustainable resource development.
